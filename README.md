# Comunity-Check-App

## Project Description

The ComCheckApp project is being developed to simplify the process of public validation of translated materials in electronic format. Users can provide comments and suggestions for changes, which are then collected and passed on to translators. Translators, in turn, discuss the proposed edits before implementing them.

## Application Functionality

The ComCheckApp provides the following functionality:
- Collection and sorting of comments in accordance with the sections and structure of the material
- Autonomous operation for receiving suggestions and comments
- Use in third-party applications for translation organization, for example, in V-Cana
- Tokenized access to a range of application APIs

## API Functions

Tokenized access is planned for the following application API functions:
- Creation of projects, books, and checks
- Book checking and downloading notes for one's book in TSV format

## Tokenized Access

Users will be provided with the ability to generate a token in the application, which will allow them to access our application's API from third-party applications. The token can be one-time or multi-use, as well as limited by time or unlimited.
